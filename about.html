            <p>We started For The Bee’s in March 2012 after reading the global agricultural and wildlife report on the state of wildlife in the new decade. Back when, YOLO and selfies were a pop-culture phenomenon. It was a devastating read and with the Colony Collapse Disorder which meant losing our bee population and the ability to pollinate fruits and vegetables. We were disheartened with the state of the bee world. Consumed with compassion for these mighty creatures it was easy to get lost into a frenzy of doom and despair however, we rose up above it; and so, we created For The Bees. A non-profit company that restores bee colonies, where we build new hives to conserve and create new bee populations, we also make an effort to bring this conversation to the front of the American consciousness. With each donation, you get a bee to track and for every dollar donated you get the converted weight of honey sent to you every month. We also allocate 75% of all proceeds from our shop to restoring bee colonies all along the east coast of North America. </p>
           <h4>Why should you care?</h4> 
           <p>Honey bees are among the most numerous and efficient pollinator species in the world. Considering that the average honey bee can visit more than 2,000 flowers in one day, these bees greatly increase the chances of a plant producing a fruit or vegetable.<br><br>
               Honey bees are the species most commonly used as commercial pollinators in the US. They are managed and used to pollinate over 100 crops grown in North America, and contribute $15 billion to the US economy every year. Many crops, such as almonds, which contribute $4.8 billion to the US industry each year, rely on honey bees for more than 90% of their pollination.<br><br>
                   But honey bees don’t only pollinate crops-- they also pollinate wild and native plants, thus contributing to all the environmental and societal benefits attributed to pollinators in general above.<br><br>
                    Last year, in 2016, 44% of managed beehives in the US died. The number of managed honey bee colonies in the United States has declined steadily over the past 60 years, from 6 million colonies (beehives) in 1947 to 4 million in 1970, 3 million in 1990, and just 2.5 million today. Overwintering loss rates have increased from the historical rate of 10-15% to approximately 30%, and beekeepers have collectively lost approximately 10 million beehives.
